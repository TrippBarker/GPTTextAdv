Welcome, my sweet morsel, to DARKWOOD FOREST! You may be asking yourself "How did I get here? Why
are my hands tied up? Who is this strange old man speaking before me??" All will be revealed in due
time! For now please sit tight, as I seem to have forgotten to pick up some much needed vegetables 
at the store for the YOU stew I am having for dinner tonight! Please feel free to struggle in your
constraints - it tenderizes the meat!! TEE-HEE-HEE *poof* *vanishes*

You find yourself sat, with your hands bound behind your back, in the middle of a dark forest.
